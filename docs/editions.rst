About Editions
==============
There are three editions of endpoints.

* Basic
* Professional
* Enterprise

Each varies in the amount and structure of the data returned.

The schema across all editions remains consistent which delivers the following benefits:

* Consistent integration with a consistent entity model
* Easily change between editions based on data depth versus performance requirements.
